# toggle-ambient-brightness

This is repository gnome-shell_extensions_toggle-ambient-brightness

This allows the auto ambient backlight (where available) function to be toggled on and off.  This works really well if you find the constantly changing brightness of the backlight is a bit intrusive.

I have tested this on my own device, a Dell Latitude 7350 Detachable, and it works fine without issues.

This code is also uploaded to extensions.gnome.org.
